My name is Josh Matheney. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Bridgewater College on May 6, 2019. To compliment my Computer Science degree, I earned a minor in Computer Information Systems with concentrations in Digital Media and Administration Management. I look forward to expanding my coding knowledge and enhancing my skills through personalized projects.
